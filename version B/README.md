\# SIMA: Stress-inducing mental arithmetic task



\## Overview - Version B



This program is the same as the base version, with the only difference that it calls the stimuli (arithmetic questions) from version B ("conditions\_math\_B.xlsx"). To be used on the second round of stress induction. 



Version B has similar questions, slightly changed, so that the difficulty is comparable, but participants cannot rely on memory from the first round. This allows for conducting two stress-induction sessions on the same participant.





Example:

*version A*

18 - 2 ?



*version B*

22 - 4 ?
